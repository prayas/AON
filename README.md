# All or Nothing (AON)
All or Nothing (AON): play a slice, win a pizza! (for teens &amp; adults)

Each player tries to complete a 12-slice pizza by adding or removing slices. In this simple arithmetic game, all age-groups can have quick fun. 

Adding or subtracting pizza slices feels like the tussle for resources that we face in life. This tussle can be won by individuals who wait and watch â€” with alertness, foresight and luck. 

Winning too early, gives less points (as the number of cards in the play space decide the points).
